## Loading and preprocessing the data
Load data and prepocess it into a time sequence
```{r}
dat <- read.csv('activity.csv')
dat$time <- sprintf('%04d', dat$interval)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}

steps <- tapply(dat$steps,as.character(dat$date),FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

hist(steps,breaks = 10)
mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median(steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}

stepsPerInterval <- tapply(dat$steps, dat$interval, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)

plot(stepsPerInterval)

```
### Summary 
The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps is 0835 with and average 206.2 steps

```{r}
summary(stepsPerInterval)
which.max(stepsPerInterval)
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
